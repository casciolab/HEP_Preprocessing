# üß†üíì EEG Preprocessing Pipeline for Heartbeat-Evoked Potentials (HEP) Analysis

This repository documents the preprocessing pipeline applied to EEG data for **HEP (heartbeat-evoked potential)** analysis.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes Before Use**

This preprocessing pipeline relies on **modified versions** of toolboxes such as **EEGLAB** and **HEPLAB**. Please note that **downloading these toolboxes directly from their official websites will not ensure compatibility**. The custom modifications are essential for the automated functionality of this pipeline.

üîå **System Compatibility**  
The entire pipeline is specifically tailored for EEG data acquired using a **128-channel EGI system** with `.mff` file formats. If you are using a different EEG system or data structure, modifications will be necessary:
- Some scripts contain **hardcoded references to 128 channels** ‚Äî these must be updated to match your system's configuration.
- The pipeline assumes `.mff` input files and uses the corresponding EEGLAB import plugins. You will need to replace or modify these import steps if your data format differs.

üìÅ **File Naming Convention**  
If your raw data adheres to this convention, **no modifications will be required** in the subject loading and naming steps.

The pipeline uses the underscore (`'_'`) as a delimiter to parse and rename datasets. To ensure seamless loading and compatibility across scripts, we **strongly recommend following this file naming format**.

---

Make sure to contact us for the toolboxes, adapt the importing function, and file naming logic to your specific dataset if it diverges from these defaults.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Following EEG acquisition, the raw data undergoes a comprehensive 12-step preprocessing procedure. The goal is to retain only high-fidelity neural signals synchronized with cardiac events.

---

## üî¨ Preprocessing Steps

Each step was carefully chosen to prepare the data for robust HEP detection and analysis:

1. üìâ **Loading and Downsampling**  
   Load data and set the data sampling rate to 512hz to optimize processing without loss of relevant information.

2. ü´Ä **Manual ECG Noise Rejection**  
   Visual inspection and manual exclusion of segments with excessive ECG or hardware noise.

3. üéö **Filtering**  
   Apply appropriate bandpass filters to isolate HEP-relevant frequency bands.

4. ‚ö° **Zapline-plus Noise Removal**  
   Automatic removal of frequency-specific line noise using **Zapline-plus** [^1].

5. üßº **Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR)**  
   Clean transient, high-amplitude artifacts using ASR to preserve valid EEG activity.

6. üìâ **Bad Channel Removal**  
   Identify and exclude consistently noisy or disconnected channels.

7. üîå **Re-referencing**  
   Re-reference the EEG signal (e.g., average or mastoid) to reduce spatial bias.

8. üíì **R-Peak Detection with HEPLAB**  
   Detect heartbeat R-peaks using the **HEPLAB toolbox** [^2]. (Modified Toolbox to run automaticly across subjects)

9. üëÅ **Visual Inspection and Correction of R-Peaks**  
   Manually verify and correct any inaccurate R-peak detections.

10. üß† **AMICA Decomposition & Eye Artifact Removal**  
    Apply **Adaptive Mixture ICA (AMICA)** [^3] to isolate and remove ocular and muscle artifacts.

11. ‚è± **Epoching**  
    Segment EEG into epochs time-locked to R-peaks for subsequent averaging and analysis.

12. üßπ **Epoch Rejection (Statistical)**  
    Discard outlier epochs based on amplitude, variance, or statistical criteria.
