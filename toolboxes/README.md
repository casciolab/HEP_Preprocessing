# 🧠 Modified EEGLAB + HEPLAB for Custom EEG Pipeline

> ⚠️ **Important:** This repository does *not* contain the full modified versions of EEGLAB and HEPLAB due to GitHub’s 25MB file size limit.

---

## 🛠️ Overview

This pipeline relies on **heavily modified versions of [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php)** and **HEPLAB** tailored specifically for heartbeat and interoception-related EEG processing.

---

## 🚫 Why the Code Isn’t Here

GitHub restricts uploads of individual files larger than 25MB via the web interface. 
Even when compressed, the full modified EEGLAB+HEPLAB package exceeds this limit.
